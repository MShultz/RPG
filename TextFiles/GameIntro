There is no sound around you. For the longest time, all you can recollect is the darkness that surrounded your being. 
Now, you feel the cold that sinks into your core; your body aches with new feelings, and the blur of life fills your eyes. 
It isn't much, but for now, it is all you have. As you pull your body off of the cold and hard floor, your vision clears with the darkness,
and you can finally look around you. You don't remember who you were, or how you've found yourself in this place. All you have are the footsteps 
ahead of you and the shadows to explore. There is an energy around you. While you do not know their intentions, you have decided to find out.
