Entrance Hall

The area is dark. You cannot see very far in front of you, but the shadows pulsate around you. To the north you can see the dark outline of a doorway.
Near the eastern wall you can see a grand staircase. It leads into the unknown of another floor, and you cannot see past the platform at the top.
Darkness swallows a break in the western wall. It can only be assumed that it is a hallway to explore.

Right Hallway

To the east is another door. From what you can tell, there is darkness inside. To the west is another room. 
A brightness comes from the crack beneath the door. This feeling-this emotion-that washes over you draws you forward. You have to get into that room.

Adult Bedroom

There is a stillness to the room. Dark drapes hang over blurry glass, keeping out any light that might sneak in. 
A large bed, with its sheets folded down on a single side, stands in the corner. 
A dresser across the room is toppled over; one drawer lies on the floor, broken into a million shards of wood.
